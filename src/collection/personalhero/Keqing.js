Sometime in 2000, Bianka was born and later found herself in a terrible situation. A Honkai outbreak struck her hometown and destroyed almost everything. However, she managed to survive due to her natural resistance to Honkai energy. Tragically, Bianka only remembered one thing after the catastrophy: her own name.

Later, Bianka was sent to an orphanage. Because she no longer remembered anything about herself except for her name, the people who ran the orphanage randomly chose January 1, 2000 as her birthday.

In the summer of 2010, Ragna, the commander of the Vanguard (aka Stormtrooper), visited the orphanage to help relieve the sorrow of those affected by Honkai Outbreak. The presence of this woman shed light on many orphans, including Bianka. Because of that, Bianka was expecting her to come back when the lilies Ragna and the orphans planted together at the orphanage have fully bloomed.

Spring 2011, Ragna did not come back as she had died in a battle. In her stead, Himeko visited the orphanage. Although Bianka hated her at first due to how different she was compared to the friendly attitude of Ragna, she quickly changed her mind when Himeko told her about the tragedy.

Bianka decided to become a strong Valkyrja as soon as possible. However, the slow and relaxed pace of the training in St. Freya Academy led her to the Schicksal HQ. Bianka then quickly became a A-Rank Valkyrja at the age of 12.

Bianka and Rita were sent on a mission to the Sea of Quantum on February 29th, 2012. Four years later, Bianka is shown to be using the name "Durandal" from a sword they met during the mission.
