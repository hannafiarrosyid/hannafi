K-423, also called Kiana Kaslana, is the heroine and the initial character in the game "Honkai Impact 3rd". She is a replica of the 2nd Herrscher with DNA of Kiana Kaslana. Her father is the current patriarch of the Kaslana family: Siegfried Kaslana. Her mother was Cecilia Schariac, known as "The Legendary Woman".
In 2008, Kiana studied at L'Aquila Primary School in Italy (reliability 30%)

In 2009, Kiana studied at Port-au-Prince High School in Haiti (reliability 20%)

In 2009, Kiana transfered to Cagayan High School in Philippines (reliability 35%)

In 2013, Kiana studied at Senba High School in Nagazora City (reliability 80%)

On December 7, 2013, the student’s disappearance was involved on the day of enrollment, and at 19:34 that night, it was found together with the deceased’s shallow warehouse. A major suspect who was found missing in the shallow warehouse showed mental abnormality before her death. Kiana was identified as a legitimate defense and did not pursue her responsibility.
In the Second Houkai War, the second Herrscher, Sirin, used the power of God Key Phoenix Down captured from Fu Hua to trap Cecilia and Siegfried in a fantasy world. However, she was not used to the powers of Phoenix Down, and ended up creating a dream rather than a nightmare. As Sirin watched the family happily celebrate Kiana's birthday in the dream, she ragingly yelled from above and desired to destroy it only more. She, however, could not help her curiousity and wanted to see what it was like to live the life of a normal, happy family's daughter, and ascended down in that dream as Phoenix Down altered the dream to make Sirin Kiana's relative who went to a boarding school. She was welcomed by Cecilia and treated wonderfully and warmly, treating her as if she was truly her own daughter, giving her cake, which teared Sirin up, reminding her of when her very own mother bought her cake.

At the same time, in the real world, the Snow Wolf team destroyed her relatives, the Trial-level Houkai beast Bella, at the same cost, realizing the strange anger of Sirin, and decided to kill the two in the fantasy world. Because the connection between the Houkai will and Sirin had been cut off and released Welt Yang's consciousness, Yang instructed Siegfried to awaken the attack and break the illusion. At this time, Sirin discovered that Cecilia had not been affected by the illusion from the beginning. In the face of Cecilia's true love for herself, Sirin's heart was shaken again.

At the end of the battle, when Otto drops the tactical nuke, Cecillia drained the Holy Blood of Estonia to purify Siberia, which was eroded by the Houkai energy, so that Black Abyss White Flower can protect Siegfried. Cecillia embraced Sirin and said "Ich liebe dich" (German "I love you") to Sirin. Cecilia's unbiased motherly love has affected Sirin's heart full of hatred, and at the last moment, the idea of ​​"if there is still a chance, I want to be Cecilia's true daughter next time" was born in Sirin's mind.
