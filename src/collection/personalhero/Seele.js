Nothing is known about Seele's birthplace or who her parents were. In early life, she lost both her parents and was then raised in Cocolia Orphanage alongside some other orphans, including Bronya and Sin Mal. Seele had the least potential to be chosen for Cocolia's experiement, however she managed to awaken her power at the last minute and replaced Sin to take part in the X-10 experiment. She did this in order to save and protect Bronya, only to lead to Bronya chasing after Seele by also participating in the experiment afterwards in hope of finding Seele. The experiment led to a failure that made Seele disappear. After that, Seele was considered dead.
Seele is a weak, quiet person, afraid of violence, and often shed tears when she is afraid.

With a Honkai mark, she is inherently highly adaptable to Honkai and exhibits greater ability to manipulate the Honkai than others. But because of her gentle nature, Seele was full of resistance and rejection of violence, and was unable to exert her full strength. Due to a long-term mental state of restraint and the influence of Honkai energy, Seele's spirit eventually split into a very sweet and kindly personality, while another one is very manipulative and dangerous.

In Honkai 3rd about Sin Mal and Seele, both of whom were adopted by Cocolia during their childhood. Seele's personality is more extroverted, and the introverted and timid Seele is completely on the opposite side. In addition, in the normal state, Seele is in everyone's eyes the type of "nothing can be done", which is more disparate with Sin Mal with exposed talent. During the training in the orphanage, Seele performed mediocrely because of suppressing her power, and was repeatedly ridiculed by Sin Mal.

From the perspective of Sin Mal, Seele, who has always been opposed to her, suddenly has a more intimate playmate. The friction between herself and her also seems to be further ignored by the other... This is for Sin Mal, who has strong self-esteem.

Therefore, Sin Mal's feelings towards Seele are more complicated. This relationship cannot be simply understood as "friend" or "hostile". It is more mixed with identification and negation, envy and disdain, complacency and inferiority, contempt and unwillingness, and so on. Seele, who is obviously weaker than herself, has been taken seriously by Bronya, but she has no status in Bronya's eyes. In the end, Sin Mal aimed her vent of these conflicting feelings at the culprit she thought caused the current situation: Bronya.

In the end, Sin Mal is jealous of the intimate relationship between Bronya and Seele, and acts to hurt Bronya.

The stigmata on Seele's body was ravaged by many organizations. She was once abducted by mercenaries and taken away from the orphanage. Fortunately, she was rescued by Bronya who had arrived alone, and was not harmed. Seele's heart is full of gratitude and love for Bronya, taking this opportunity as an opportunity to form a friendship with Bronya and become close friends. The cruel and belligerent personality also had a strange feeling for seeing Bronya's murder scene.

However, when Bronya found Seele, the inner Seele appeared behind Bronya. Seele's fear called her demon inside, and unexpectedly caused Bronya's misunderstanding, so she had to make a promise to Seele not to hurt anyone anymore. Bronya didn't fight back in order to fulfill the agreement with Seele, so she was pushed down from the stairs and it caused a fracture. Seeing all the past, Seele was so timid that she couldn't move. When Seele rebuked herself in a toy box, Bronya ignored the body to comfort the crying Seele.

Seele felt guilty and painful for her weakness, who had witnessed the violence but didn't stop it. Seele's personality took advantage of the imagination and encouraged Seele to avenge Sin Mal and occupy Seele. Later that night, Seele sneaked into Sin Mal's room and physically and mentally tortured her, causing Sin Mal's spirit to collapse.

But at this time, Seele found the information in Sin Mal's hand, and knew that Bronya and Sin Mal were going to be sent to the X-10 experiment, so he begged Cocolia to use the hidden stigmata as a sufficient Qualified subject to replace Bronya as the subject.

After the experiment began, Seele met her personality in a fantasy, that is, the stigmata of eternal resentment against Honkai. The stigmata has changed into Sin Mal, Cocolia, and Bronya, but in order to prevent Seele from experimenting, she made her own awareness, opened the Toy box of Isaac, and finally saw the creation of the The missing body "Bronya". However, things didn't go as expected. After a short success, Seele's body quickly quantified. Seele's left the laboratory in the Deep Sea and rushed to the orphanage in order to be able to see Bronya again. In the end, she only had time to pass my hair accessories to Bronya.

After knowing the truth of the matter, Bronya was forced to die, and risked her life to conduct experiments. After the experiment had passed the safety time limit, Bronya used her own will to prevent the experiment from ending. She only wanted to stay with Seele forever. But Seele, at the quantum level, didn't want Bronya to disappear with herself in this way, so she gave the power of "Rebuild" to Bronya in the form of a Remodeled Bunny 19c and returned it to the real world. She continued to stay for the moment awaiting the fulfillment of the agreement in the sea of quantum.

In the experiment in the summer of 2012, the girl named Bronya lost many things.
Her legs were completely destroyed by the Honkai. Without exoskeleton armor, even movement is impossible.
A part of her brain was burned. Since then, she can no longer feel joy nor smile.
And she lost the most important Seele...
Only this sadness, She don't want to forget before meeting Seele again.
