Despite being an S-rank Valkyrie, Rita is known as a humble and polite individual. Befitting her role as a maid, she radiates grace and elegance wherever she goes. Rita is also caring to those around her and will always note of their likes and dislikes.

But underneath her exterior, Rita is an efficient spy and assassin working under Otto who wont hesitate to kill in order to complete her goals, though she will only do it in the name of the mission.

Nevertheless, RIta is a kind person who will always save lives whenever she can despite her more violent method in solving problems.

Rita is the vice captain of "Immortal Blades" and the trusted adjutant of Durandal, and one of three S-Rank Valkyries in Schicksal working under Otto. She is dubbed the Schicksal maid.

Not much is known about Rita as she is very secretive and discreet about sharing information. It is possible that only Durandal and the other Valkyrie members of "Immortal Blades" would have more personal information of her.
